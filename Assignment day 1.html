    <h1>HTML BASICS</h1>
    <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.For ex, content could be stuctured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.It consist of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph  by enclosing it in paragraph tags.The main parts of our element are THE OPENING TAG , THE CLOSING TAG, THE CONTENT, THE ELEMENT. Elements can also have attributes. There are some elements which do not have content and are known as Empty Elements.
